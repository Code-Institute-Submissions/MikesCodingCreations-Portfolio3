## Introduction
Mike's Battleship Game is a Python console-based application that recreates the classic game of Battleship. The game allows players to strategically place their battleships on a grid and engage in a battle against the computer. It provides an entertaining and engaging experience for users to test their tactical skills and luck.

## Game Rules
1. The game board is a square grid where you and the computer place battleships.

3. Each battleship occupies multiple adjacent cells either horizontally (H) or vertically (V).
4. Players take turns attacking the opponent's board by guessing positions.
5. If a player's attack hits a battleship, it is a hit.
